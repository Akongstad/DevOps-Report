\section{Process' Perspective}
\label{sec:process_perspective}

% interact as developers, how is the team organised?


\subsection{CI/CD chains}
% github workflows
% - A complete description of stages and tools included in the CI/CD chains.
% That is, including deployment and release of your systems.

\subsection{GitHub}
% Organization of your repositor(ies).
% That is, either the structure of of mono-repository or organization of artifacts across repositories.
% In essence, it has to be be clear what is stored where and why.

\subsubsection{Organization of Repositories And Branching Strategy}
%Think this can include development process and tools e.g. issues and the project tab in GitHub.
% Draft: feel free to edit/ delete
Issues in GitHub are used to track what needs to be done, and how far a task is from completion. Upon creation, issues are given tags as well as being organized into Projects.

%branching STRATEGY:
%Can't push to main, need two reviewers on a pull request
%Need one review on pull requests to production
% Trunk based - stuff on main are in a working state

% - Applied branching strategy.
% - Applied development process and tools supporting it
% For example, how did you use issues, Kanban boards, etc. to organize open tasks


\subsection{Monitoring And Logs}
%kibana and grafana
%metrics
% How do you monitor your systems and what precisely do you monitor?
% What do you log in your systems and how do you aggregate logs?

\subsection{Security}
% Brief results of the security assessment.


\subsection{Scaling And Load balancing}
% Applied strategy for scaling and load balancing.
% In essence it has to be clear how code or other artifacts come from idea into the running system and everything that happens on the way.
