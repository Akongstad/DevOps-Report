\section{Process' Perspective}
\label{sec:process_perspective}

% interact as developers, how is the team organised?


\subsection{CI/CD chains}
% github workflows

\subsection{GitHub}

\subsubsection{Organization of repositories and branching strategy}
%Think this can include development process and tools e.g. issues and the project tab in GitHub.
% Draft: feel free to edit/ delete
Issues in GitHub are used to track what needs to be done, and how far a task is from completion. Upon creation, issues are given tags as well as being organized into Projects.

%branching STRATEGY:
%Can't push to main, need two reviewers on a pull request
%Need one review on pull requests to production
% Trunk based?

\subsection{monitoring and logs}
%kibana and grafana
%metrics

\subsection{scaling and load balacing}
% does security assessment need its own sub-subsection?
