The following section contains the lessons learned, bigger issues encountered and how they were solved.
\subsection{Refactoring}
% - evolution and refactoring
% Notes: Translating the flask frontend to react.deciding what language and framework to work with for front- and backend. Major lessons? Learned a little python through refactoring from python to c#?
An issue we had when refactoring from the original mini-twit to C\# and ReactJS was \textit{transcribing} the flask frontend to ReactJS. Most of the team had little to no experience with the framework before working on the project, though the biggest issue were understanding what the flask module were doing. The team solved the issue by stop looking at the flask frontend and make our own with inspiration from the original structure in the UI. The team learned to understand python when refactoring to C\#.

% - Also reflect and describe what was the "DevOps" style of your work. For example, what did you do differently to previous development projects and how did it work?
%Notes: automatic releases, more than 1 github action to ensure code quality
